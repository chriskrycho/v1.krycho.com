            <p>
              Since we moved to Colorado, a few pretty major things have
              happened.
            </p>
            <h2 id="1thehouse">1. The house</h2>
            <p>
              The timing for our house got bumped around. A <em>bunch</em>. We
              moved expecting that we'd likely end up moving in sometime in
              December, and shortly after getting here, we got scheduled to do a
              final walk-through on the house on December 15 and to close
              December 22. We planned to move in on December 23, and enjoy a
              family Christmas in our new home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then there was a problem with the cabinets. And cabinets delayed a
              bunch of <em>other</em> things. And we have a good builder, and so
              they opted to delay… but that includes needing to delay past the
              Christmas break, and then that bumped into <em>other</em> people's
              closing schedules, so we got bumped back nearly a full month. New
              final walkthrough date: January 10. New closing date: January 17.
              New likely move-in date (because who's around to help move in on a
              Thursday?): January 20.
            </p>
            <p>
              Given that, as I'm writing this, we were originally hoping to be
              in our house already... we're disappointed. It'll be okay, of
              course, and we're now less than four weeks out, but it was an
              annoying bump, to say the least.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand… it’s still gorgeous, and we’re giddy to get to
              live there in short order.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <h2 id="2mydadshealth">2. My dad's health</h2>
            <p>
              The much bigger bump for us, which I haven’t written about
              publicly yet at all, is that less than a week after we got here we
              learned that my dad has a brain tumor, which turned out to be
              relatively aggressive—though, thankfully, not as aggressive as it
              could be: it’s a Stage 3 and not a Stage 4 tumor.<sup
                class="footnote-ref"
                ><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              “Has,” I say, not “had,” because although he’s had a
              very-successful-under-the-circumstances surgery that removed
              ~80–85% of the tumor, there’s still that final ~15–20% hanging
              around in his brain. He'll be starting chemo and radiation early
              next week, with the aim of
              <em>preventing further growth</em>—because killing this kind of
              tumor isn’t really an outcome the neural oncologist even looks
              for. The outlook is good, as far as brain tumors go: this
              treatment approach has an average outcome of 10–15 years of
              management of the tumor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Still: this isn’t exactly news you ever want to hear. It’s been a
              bumpy road. God has given us enormous grace to walk through it,
              but we are <em>tired</em>.
            </p>
            <h2 id="3ourchurch">3. Our church</h2>
            <p>
              Gladly, the last <em>major</em> thing that has happened in our
              lives is that we’ve joined a healthy church here in the
              area—Forestgate Presbyterian Church (PCA)—and it’s already been a
              great blessing to us. If it seems odd to you that we joined a PCA
              church immediately after I finished my M. Div. at a Southern
              Baptist seminary, well, the hilarity of it isn’t lost on us,
              either. But that’s where we’ve landed—and by conviction, not by
              convenience. I’ll probably write at some length on my
              <a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com">personal site</a> about how
              we chose this specific congregation. I doubt I’ll ever
              <em>blog</em> about the transition from being a Baptist to being a
              Presbyterian, as it’s the kind of post that’s apt to generate more
              heat than light. (I’m happy to talk about it in personal
              conversation, of course!)
            </p>
            <p>
              The details of how we ended up there aside, the congregation has
              been <em>incredibly</em> welcoming to us; it’s no exaggeration to
              say it’s the most hospitable congregation I’ve ever even visited.
              We’ve begun to make friends, and look forward to continuing to
              make friends in the months ahead; and we’re incredible excited for
              our house to be done so we can start using it for hospitality to
              others ourselves! We’re also looking forward to digging in and
              finding out where best we can serve now and thinking about what it
              will look like to plant deep roots here and serve for the decades
              ahead as well. (There are people, including elders, who have been
              at Forestgate since it was planted in late 1986—before I was born.
              That’s incredibly inspiring and encouraging to us!)
