            <p>
              The last year, as I alluded to in an
              <a href="https://v1.krycho.com/a-few-life-updates/"
                >earlier post</a
              >
              in this space, has been pretty full. We moved across the country,
              we walked through the most difficult phases (so far, and Lord
              willing for good) of my dad's treatment for an aggressive brain
              tumor (he's winning, praise God), joined a new church, and moved
              into a new house.
            </p>
            <p>
              This after half a decade of seminary life where I was working part
              time as well, where we added another kid to our family's life and
              walked through some of the hardest parts of Jaimie's struggle with
              depression.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's not really a surprise that
              <a href="https://www.chriskrycho.com/burnout/"
                >I'm dealing with some burnout</a
              >. Life has been <em>hard</em> in a bunch of different ways! So
              I'm continuing to practice resting well. I made myself play video
              games a few times this week – that way of putting it is
              intentional; it really felt like <em>making</em> myself do it. I
              expect it may take a while for me to be back to normal, and that's
              okay.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's okay in one sense because this is just how life goes. But
              it's also okay because life is genuinely really good in many ways
              right now. We live in a beautiful place, for one thing; and that
              is a comfort and joy to my soul many days.
            </p>

              For another, our little girls are thriving here. The move and all
              these changes haven't been without their struggles and challenges
              and pains for them, of course. Both of them tell us regularly that
              they miss their friends from North Carolina, and both of them have
              more than once told us that they miss living in North Carolina.
            </p>
            <p>
              And who can blame them? Jaimie and I are both <em>very</em> happy
              to have moved here, but <em>we</em> miss our friends in North
              Carolina sometimes!
            </p>
            <p>How in the world are they already 4 and 6, though?</p>

              We're trying to find our new rhythms in all of this. We're leading
              a small group for
              <a href="https://forestgate.org">our wonderful church</a>, and
              Jaimie is serving with the women's discipleship ministry and in
              the music team, and Kate is doing kindergarten and Elayne starting
              &quot;first grade&quot; – put in quotes because she's already
              reading up a storm: she loved
              <em>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</em> and we need to buy
              her the next volume of <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>. But all
              of that is new! We don't have our routines in place yet; we
              haven't figured out what our day-to-day and week-to-week routines
              and patterns are.
            </p>
            <p>
              Part and parcel with that: I'm still figuring out my own work
              rhythms and routines, and trying to find (or better: make!) time
              for building friendships. In North Carolina, I hit a coffee shop
              at least once a week, just to get out of our apartment. I feel the
              need for that somewhat less keenly here in no small part because
              my home office setup is really, really great. But a big part of
              what I gained from going to a coffee shop every week was
              <em>social interaction</em> outside my house. For the first time
              since I started working remotely, I've found myself seeing no one
              but my family except on Sundays for church – and I need to change
              this up!
            </p>
            <!--kg-card-end: markdown-->

            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
            <p>
              Most of that is neither good nor bad, exactly; it just
              <em>is</em>. The worst I can say for most of it (now that we seem
              to be through the worst with my dad's brain tumor) is that it's
              low-level-but-constantly-stressful! That's not all that helpful
              for getting rid of burnout, but it's not the end of the world,
              either. And we're still really happy to be here, grateful for our
              congregation at Forestgate, glad to be nearer to family, happy to
              be by the mountains, happy to have a house we can use to host and
              bless others.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's pretty much it as far as life right now goes. It's up and
              down, and that's what we expect it to be until our King comes
              again.
