            <p>
              I've been thinking about reading plans and book lists. And about
              rest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Plans and lists may not sound like rest to you; that's fine: they
              don't to me, either. I've been eager to move back into the kinds
              of reading I'm actively interested in doing now that I'm done with
              my seminary degree. But one of the challenges is that I need—and
              I'm <em>very</em> aware of this need—to decompress a bit.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last roughly 8 years have been <em>going</em> fairly
              constantly. I began my first job after college the day after
              Jaimie and I got back from our honeymoon. For the next two years I
              worked full-time there <em>and</em> taught myself web development
              and then did 8--10 hours a week of web development consulting on
              the side while she finished school. I kept up that pace for
              another year and a half after that other than a slight break just
              after Ellie was born, and then we moved to North Carolina for me
              to get an M. Div. from <a href="http://www.sebts.edu">SEBTS</a>.
              Since we moved here, I've always been working—anywhere from 20 to
              60 hours a week, always in at least one class a semester and often
              as many as three. All along the way, I've also been reading and
              writing for myself: these things are relaxing for me. And for the
              sheer joy and need of a good outlet, I added podcasting along the
              way as a hobby.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the takeaway of all of that is that I've had to be
              <em>extremely</em> structured and disciplined with my time. I have
              always had a detailed schedule and an idea of what I wanted or
              needed to be working on at any given time: from learning new
              things in software to writing blog posts, and from actually
              programming as a job to writing papers for seminary.
            </p>
            <p>It's time to breathe a bit.</p>
            <p>
              I feel very keenly the need to <em>decompress</em>. Not to stop
              doing things, but to add some slack to the schedule, to keep my
              number of hard external commitments low and to keep any
              self-imposed pressures low as well. That will let me recharge and
              avoid burnout, and it will give me lots of good time to just hang
              out with Jaimie and our little girls. We've made space for the
              family all the way through, but it has always been a matter of
              scheduling it and fitting it in. I'm looking forward to a season
              where it's just normal for us to play and read and do life
              together. As I said: a kind of decompression, letting things
              stretch back out a bit and decreasing the tension of always being
              on a tight schedule.
            </p>
            <p>
              That means that until about January 2018, I am not making myself a
              <em>reading list</em> in the way I want to in the future. Why do I
              even want that? Because I <em>need</em> it. So the better question
              is: why do I think I need a reading list or a plan?
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm a voracious, multi-disciplinary reader, but this has two
              problems. One is I can be a bit like a squirrel: always seeing
              something shiny in that new subject <em>over there</em>. The other
              is that I can get sucked incredibly deep into one genre so that I
              end up reading only theology or programming or the like for six
              months. Having a plan and a reading list will help me both dig
              deeply and in focused ways into the subjects on which I want to
              think (and write!) more, but it will also help me balance that
              with a good mix of other kinds of reading from other
              fields—something which is both broadly helpful and which
              inevitably
              <a
                href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/art/and-the-stew-tastes-good/"
                >produces a better mix of insights</a
              >
              than just reading one subject in isolation does.
            </p>
            <p>But, for all the reasons outlined above: not now.</p>
            <p>
              I still have books I want to read over the rest of this year. The
              list right now looks like this:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Stewart Brand,
                <em>How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built</em>
              </li>
              <li>Lois McMaster Bujold, <em>Shards of Honor</em></li>
              <li>Fyodor Dostoevsky, <em>The Idiot</em></li>
              <li>Daniel Kahneman, <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em></li>
              <li>Oliver O'Donovan, <em>Resurrection and Moral Order</em></li>
              <li>
                Brandon Sanderson, the various sequels to
                <em>Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians</em> (which I read and
                quite enjoyed last month)
              </li>
              <li>Charles Taylor, <em>A Secular Age</em></li>
              <li>J. R. R. Tolkien, <em>Beren and Lúthien</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              That's a &quot;list,&quot; but it's a list composed of exactly one
              kind of book: whatever I feel like reading. There are other books
              I've already started that aren't on that list because while
              they're important to me, they're not decompressive at all: they
              feel like work, like pressure. And what I and my family need right
              now—especially in the midst of planning a cross-country move to be
              nearer our families in a new home!—is to relieve pressure, not add
              more.
            </p>
            <p>
              So now I'm going to go read one of those books on our porch.
              Whichever one I feel like. And then I'll read whichever one I feel
              like <em>next</em>. And if the list changes, that's fine too.
