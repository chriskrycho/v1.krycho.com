            <p>
              This is a new kind of Saturday for me, and one I've been looking
              forward to for a <em>very</em> long time: one in our new home,
              with little that needs doing (and all of that of the fairly
              ordinary chore sort).
            </p>
            <p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Moving in was a busy few days, of course: we signed papers for our
              mortgage<sup class="footnote-ref"
                ><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup
              >
              last Wednesday (10 days ago), moved all our boxes and beds and
              things on Thurdsay, and unpacked all day Friday and Saturday.
              Sunday ended up being a really wonderfully restful day for our
              family: it <em>snowed</em>, and snowed hard. Hard enough that we
              opted not to mess with the drive to church – a drive that is
              thankfully much shorter now, and probably <em>fine</em> that day
              given it mostly involves high-traffic roads, but we were all
              fatigued enough that we simply opted not to risk it.
            </p>
            <p>Monday I was back at work... in my new office.</p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="https://v1.krycho.com/content/images/2018/01/5EB8ED50-4F5B-4E22-92F5-32DBA5A6DF7E.jpeg"
                alt="5EB8ED50-4F5B-4E22-92F5-32DBA5A6DF7E"
                title="Office picture"
                loading="lazy"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              I got very spoiled with my office view in North Carolina – an
              upstairs bedroom that looked out on a forest filled with tall
              trees and the occasional bald eagle. But I think it's fair to say
              this is not a step down. Those mountains you can see in the
              background are mere miles from here – I can run to the base of
              them (and already have) – from our home here in the foothills.
            </p>
            <p>
              And now I'm sitting here on a Saturday, updating our address in a
              few places and mostly just enjoying our home and staring out our
              kitchen widnow at the view as a write this. (I keep getting
              distracted!)
            </p>
            <p>
              It's strange: though we have been in Colorado for three full
              months already – and they have been
              <a href="https://v1.krycho.com/a-few-life-updates/"
                >full indeed</a
              >
              – there is a real sense in which we are just starting this new
              phase of life now. We did what we could, especially in starting to
              engage with our new church, while still living with my parents.
              But we were a full thirty minutes drive then from what is now our
              neighborhood and community; we could hardly get a YMCA membership
              or otherwise find our new rhythms and routines. And our schedule
              was necessarily (and not at all in a bad way) one of working
              around my parents' schedules (and they ours!). We could not really
              host people in our home, as has long been our practice.
            </p>
            <p>Now we can. It's delightful.</p>
            <p>
              I'm looking forward to – Lord willing! – many decades of Saturdays
              sitting at this little island in our kitchen, reading and writing;
              and breaking to help my little girls as they play and sign and
              dance around their play room and our living room. It's nice to be
              home.
