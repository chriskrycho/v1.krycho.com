            <p>
              My heart can't take any more serious posts right now. In the
              spirit of laughter being good medicine, let me regale you with a
              tale of one of my most embarassing moments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those of you who know me know that I am a writer and, therefore, a
              reader. One of my favorite modern fantasy authors is named Brandon
              Sanderson (who I will hereby christen &quot;Branderson&quot; for
              the sake of brevity). Well, Branderson was a-comin' to Raleigh
              town, and I was hell-bent on getting close enough to give him a
              big old creepy fan-girl hug. He was, after all, one of the authors
              who inspired me to write my first full-length fantasy novel, and
              that is certainly hug-worthy.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this particular book tour, there was this contest. The prize
              was that you got to be a part of Branderson's team of helpers
              during his visit to the bookstore. An essay and a few fervent
              prayers later, I was chosen as one of the team members! Hot dog!
              Happiest day of my life.
            </p>
            <p>
              After meeting my delightful team members the evening before the
              event, I headed to the bookstore the next day, looking as cutely
              nerdy as I could: hair curled and wearing heeled boots to
              represent a certain character from the book series (Min, for those
              of you who are wondering 😂), and sporting my &quot;Memory
              Keepers&quot; t-shirt that was a nod to the title of the last book
              of &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; series.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="https://v1.krycho.com/content/images/2017/06/IMG_0287.JPG"
                alt=""
                loading="lazy"
              /><br />
              ^<em>Here I am, thinking I'm all cool and stuff.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              We started by meeting Branderson. I was feeling so star-struck
              that I was practically fawning. As we started assisting him, I was
              desperate to find things to do to be helpful. By and by he was
              signing pre-ordered books for fans, when the bookstore owner
              asked,
              <strong
                >&quot;Can someone get a water bottle for Mr.
                Sanderson?&quot;</strong
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;I will!&quot; I cried, and before anyone else had time to
              draw breath I had run to the cooler and plucked out a bottle.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was feeling pretty great at this point. My chest swelled with
              pride at being able to get this wonderful author the water that he
              asked for. How useful and neat was I?
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, in my enthusiasm, a new idea blossomed.
              <em>Not only will I</em> fetch
              <em>the water bottle for Brandon, I'll</em> open
              <em>it for him, too!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              So I did that thing I do: I turned the plastic lid far enough to
              break the seal, then left it just like that as I put it down
              beside Branderson.
            </p>
            <p>
              Naturally, when one is signing books, elbows are everywhere. And,
              a few minutes later, as if in slow motion, I saw my favorite
              author's elbow bump the bottle. As it toppled against the table,
              the half-screwed-on lid popped off and water spilled
              <em>everywhere</em>. All over the pre-ordered, signed books. All
              over Branderson.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Wanna get away? Yes. Oh, yes, I do.</strong></p>
            <p>
              He was miffed. He was annoyed. He was frustrated. And it was all
              my fault.
            </p>
            <p>
              I seriously could've cried, but I didn't let on that I was the one
              who had perpetrated this crime. Instead, I held it in for almost
              five years, and now I confess before you, dear reader, for your
              entertainment. Are you not entertained?
            </p>
            <p>
              Oh, before I go, another embarassing thing I did on the same day:
              I sang a nerdy song I had written about &quot;The Wheel of
              Time&quot; for all the fans standing in line for autographs.
              That's not the embarrassing part; it was well-received, in fact,
              Branderson himself was highly amused by it. However, Branderson
              had not seen which of us females on the helping team had sung it,
              so he asked the girl beside me if that had been her voice he
              heard. I quickly piped up that it was me. Now, my husband knows
              that when I'm high on adrenaline, I get punchy and snarky. So
              after piping up that it was me, I said, &quot;Did you not think it
              was me because I'm <em>short?</em> <em>Huh, Brandon?&quot;</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              Yeah. I accused him of judging people by their height at the same
              time I called him by his first name. Smooth, Jaimie, smooth.
            </p>
            <p>I should've stuck with the creepy fan-girl hug.</p>
