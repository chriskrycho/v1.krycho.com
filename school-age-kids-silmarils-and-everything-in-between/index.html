              Well, dear readers, Chris dropped several not-so-subtle hints in
              his latest post that I should update readers on life through my
              eyes. So, as I sit in this ice-cold coffee shop, I will attempt to
              dredge up some tidbits that might be of interest to you.
            </p>
            <h3 id="homeschooling">Homeschooling</h3>
            <p>
              We are in the full swing of homeschool now! I still haven’t
              “named” my homeschool (it feels silly, and it’s not required by
              law), <em>a la</em> the last homeschooling post I wrote on this
              blog. I have a second-grader and a kindergartener, so we’re down
              to business and, for the most part, loving it. I had to laugh at
              the aforementioned post, in which I claimed that homeschooling (at
              least, at the kindergarten level) was “easy.” Nice thought, past
              self, nice thought. It is, in fact, very challenging at this
              point...which means it’s also very rewarding.
            </p>
            <p>
              We transitioned from doing Classical Conversations (you can ask me
              about that, sometime - it was not a good fit for us) last school
              year to the Sonlight curriculum (literature-based) for the
              2019-2020 year. We <em>love</em> Sonlight, for both girls! It’s
              simultaneously rigorous and colorful and engaging and well-suited
              to my girls’ different personalities. <em>I’m</em> enjoying
              re-learning things I haven’t heard since grade school, as well as
              experiencing children's classics I’ve never read (such as
              <em>Charlotte’s Web</em>).  I’m learning how to roll with the
              emotional and scholastic punches, tailoring my teaching and the
              material to my and my children’s needs. What does that look like?
              Skipping a boring read-aloud here and there. Doing an all-science
              day every once in awhile. Deciding that perhaps Sonlight language
              arts (difficult stuff for the age level) can be subbed out for
              something more tailored to Elayne's math/science-oriented brain.
              In short, I’m learning <em>flexibility</em>, which has never been
              one of my overarching character traits!
            </p>
            <p>
              We’re endeavoring to meet the 4 hours per day for 172 days
              requirement with enthusiasm and verve! Like in any job, some days
              are harder than others. Some days, the last thing I want to do is
              teach. But once we get started, the girls and I find comfort in
              the familiar schedule and delight in the fascinating material.
              Like, for example, <em>how cool</em> is ancient Egypt?! Extra
              points for anyone who knows what a <em>hemhemet</em> is (Elayne
              had to remind me...).
            </p>
            <p>
              We’re still using Saxon for math, and <em>loving</em> it. Elayne
              requests that I give her math worksheets in her free time.
              <em>cough </em>The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, CHRIS.
              <em>cough</em>

              I’ve concentrated on what Elayne is doing (since she’s doing more
               “official” school), but what about Kate? Well, Kate’s thriving.
              She just finished her Kindergarten math book and is about to move
              onto first grade level math. She’s 5 1/5. I’m in for it! She also
              just started reading in earnest, and is proving herself to be as
              much a bibliophile are her sister and, well, both her parents.

              What a delightful foray into JRR Tolkien’s imaginarium! I’m
              learning details about the underlying subtleties of
              <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy that are legit
              <em>blowing my mind</em>. The man was a true artistic genius! Of
              course, I have my husband and good NC friend Caleb to help walk me
              through the confusion of the various names in made-up languages.
              You’d think that, as a fantasy writer, I’d be used to it by now.

              Speaking of being a fantasy writer...I’m still writing. At least,
              I was a few months ago. I’ve let it go because I felt stymied. I
              do not commend this course of action.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm working on a fantasy novella that I’ve shared with a grand
              total of...two people. It’s in progress. Might be for awhile. But
              good things are worth taking time on... what? What’s that you say?
              Self-justifying? Codswallop!

              I joined a CrossFit gym with my neighbor Nicole. Why yes, I
              <em>do</em> consistently hurt in places I didn’t know existed.

              It’s cool, though. I actually kind of love it. We did rope climbs
              today. ROPE CLIMBS, people! If that’s not cool, I don’t know what
              is. I felt like Mulan trying to retrieve the arrow from the top of
              the post.

              I love my church and my neighborhood. So. Very. Much. I’ve been
              involved in coordinating the women’s Titus 2 ministry, teaching
              Bible study, serving in the nursery, serving on the worship team
              as a singer, and hosting a small group, among other things. You
              could say I’m very entrenched in our church now and LOVING it.
              Churches are made up of sinful people (of which I am not the
              least), so there is difficulty, but I’m beginning to see it as a
              beautiful kind of difficulty. Slowly but surely.

              My mental heath is really good, overall. Praise God! I can say
              with confidence I’m doing better now than I have been in the last
              <em>decade</em>. And I’m going to leave you on that note because
              it is just such a testimony of hope - hope that I want to
              encourage <em>you</em> with.
            </p>
            <p>
              Oh, wait. I guess the note I want to leave you on is this: I don't
              know WHY my husband wanted to post that particular picture of me
              in the last blog entry. Seriously, guys, with every year that
              passes, I <em>lose</em> two or three wrinkles and look two or
              three years younger. Like Benjamin Button. Really. The picture is
              a lie.
