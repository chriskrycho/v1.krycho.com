            <p>
              For the past four years, I've been frequenting
              <a href="http://jubalacoffee.com">a local coffee shop</a> every
              Friday, because they provide free shots of single origin espresso
              on Fridays for anyone who asks for one. It's part of their goal to
              help people come to appreciate <em>good</em> coffee. It's a huge
              part of why I'm the coffee snob I am.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the last few months, I've been thinking a <em>lot</em> about
              how I can continue to invest in my relationship with my daughters.
              I'm keenly aware of how quickly they're growing up, and I feel
              very deeply the fact that I was very busy during my years in
              seminary. I want to take more, and more intentional, time with
              them in the months and years ahead, than I was able to when
              working nearly full time and taking classes at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
              So a few weeks ago, I decided that my Friday morning outings—which
              haven't been a particularly <em>productive</em> time for me
              work-wise for many months anyway—are now
              <em>daddy-daughter discipleship times</em>. Each week, I bring one
              of my little girls with me to the coffee shop, and we just talk.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
              An important aside here: these aren't &quot;daddy-daughter
              dates.&quot; I have no idea where that language came from, and I
              think it's ridiculous. Why, you ask? Isn't it just a sweet thing,
              you ask? Because it is absurd, and conflates kinds of things that
              ought not be conflated, and reflects a failure to understand all
              sorts of good kinds of different relationships. If I had sons
              instead, and took <em>them</em> to a coffee shop, it would
              obviously not be a date. When I have drinks with one of the guys
              I'm close friends with, it's not a date. <em>Dates</em> are things
              of romance. What I'm doing with my daughters is, as should not
              need explaining, <em>not</em> a thing of romance. Perhaps I'll
              write more on this at some point, but suffice it to say for now
              that I <em>love</em> spending special one-on-one time with my
              daughters, and am happy to call it almost anything… but not a
              &quot;date.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>Now: back to your regularly scheduled programming.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>
              What do we talk about on these outings? Well, whatever they want
              to talk about, mostly. At 5 and 3 respectively, Ellie and Kate
              have a lot to say that isn't intrinsically interesting to me, of
              course. But they're my daughters, and I love them, and so I
              listen. (Would that I were as good at this the rest of the week as
              I have been so far on these coffee shop outings!) And then, for
              some part of the outing, we talk about theology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yes. Theology. You'd be amazed how much a 5-year-old or a
              3-year-old can take on and understand. And of course their
              understanding is relatively superficial compared to what it will
              be in a few decades. But it's a foundation on which they can build
              everything else later. That's why we have helped them memorize
              Scripture from an early age, and why we started working through
              the Heidelberg Catechism with Ellie when she turned four. They
              don't have to understand every detail now for it to be helpful.
            </p>
            <p>
              But I <em>am</em> aiming for these morning outings to be things
              they can understand. Teaching them that God is
              <em>good and holy</em>, for example. Or, today, walking through
              the &quot;creation, fall, redemption, restoration&quot; shorthand
              with Ellie to help her fit the pieces of the Biblical story
              together. We talked about what the words meant, and what happened
              in that part of the story—pieces she already knew, from our
              reading the Bible together, but helping her see what they meant.
              And then we talked about the fact that it's <em>our</em> story.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the sweetest joys of this so far (and we're only three
              weeks into it!) is how much it has been good for <em>me</em>.
              Doing the work of finding a way to speak truth to little kids
              often makes me feel that truth more keenly again. Things that have
              (rightly, even) become <em>normal</em> to be (in a good way) rise
              to the level of conscious notice (also in a good way) and I
              remember what it was like to learn them, and it is good. And I
              hope my joy and enthusiasm for knowing God will help my girls to
              grow and flourish in the same.
